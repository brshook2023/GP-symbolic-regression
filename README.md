# Genetic Programming in the Symbolic Regression Domain

This repository contains files relating to a project in my Machine Reasoning course in the Fall of 2020. This project involved us implementing a genetic algorithm and applying it to find functions that fit two datasets containing inputs and outputs. Additionally, the project required us to perform experiments and write a paper on our results. A PDF of the paper is contained in this repository.
