# Genetic Programming in the Symbolic Regression Domain

This repository contains my final project for Machine Reasoning (CSC 370) at Davidson College in the Fall of 2020.

This project involved us implementing a genetic algorithm and applying it to find functions that fit two datasets containing inputs and outputs. Additionally, the project required us to perform experiments and write a paper on our results. A PDF of the paper is contained in this repository.
